The goal of rdcmchecks is to provide utility functions for checking arguments provided to functions across the suite of r-dcm packages.
Rather than duplicating code for checking arguments across packages, check functions can be added to rdcmchecks, which can in turn be imported to any needed packages.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rdcmchecks from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("rdcmchecks")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-dcm/rdcmchecks")
```
