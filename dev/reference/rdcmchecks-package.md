# rdcmchecks: Common Argument Checks for 'r-dcm' Packages

Many packages in the 'r-dcm' family take similar arguments, which are
checked for expected structures and values. Rather than duplicating code
across several packages, commonly used check functions are included
here. This package can then be imported to access the check functions in
other packages.
