The goal of rdcmchecks is to provide utility functions for checking
arguments provided to functions across the suite of r-dcm packages.
Rather than duplicating code for checking arguments across packages,
check functions can be added to rdcmchecks, which can in turn be
imported to any needed packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdcmchecks from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-dcm/rdcmchecks")
```
